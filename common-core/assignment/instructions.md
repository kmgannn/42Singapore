Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.) except for undefined behavior. If this occurs, your project will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• All heap-allocated memory must be properly freed when necessary. Memory leaks will not be tolerated.
• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.

• Your Makefile must contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.
• To submit bonuses for your project, you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless
the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is
conducted separately.
• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your project’s Makefile must compile
the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
• We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work
does not need to be submitted and will not be graded. It will give you an
opportunity to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find these tests
especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use
your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
